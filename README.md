## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS - For styling
- json-server - For mock api

### What I learned

I built this project using Next.js and TypeScript to practice what I learned from the Next.js and TypeScript course I took. For example, I used useSearchParams() to get and set query parameters. This makes it easier to share a link without losing the URL state, and even when the page is reloaded, the query remains stored in the URL.

I also learned how to determine when a component should be a client component by using "use client". Declaring a component as a client component allows it to handle interactions and events (e.g., click events) on the frontend.

### Continued development

I plan to work on more advanced projects using Next.js to further enhance my skills and take my expertise to the next level

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install

npx json-server --watch data.json --port 3001

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
